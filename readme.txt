Hey, I'm Leonardo Augusto Pereira (odraencoded) and this is my entry for the 31th Ludum Dare game making competititon.

Dodge Pong is a simple arcade game, like Asteroids or Pong.

How to play:
	Hit the ball to score points.
	Get hit by the ball and that's game over.

	
Controls:
	Moving: Arrow keys
	Swing racket: D key
	New game: N key
	Pause: ESC


Scoring:
	The bar at the top of the game shows your score in this order (from when a new game started until you get hit)
	Score points - The points you earned
	Accuracy - number of times you hit a ball / number of times you tried to hit a ball
	Streak - Number of times you hit a ball without missing
	Time - How long have you been playing for
